## Data Types in GeoProcessing

- vector data
- raster data
- alphanumeric

### Vector Data

- points
- lines
- polygons

Vector data is stored as a series of x,y coordinates.  Each point is a pair of x,y coordinates.  A line is a series of points.  A polygon is a series of points that are connected to form a closed shape.

### Raster Data

Raster data is stored as a grid of cells.  It is like a matrix.  Each cell has a value.  The value could be a number, a category, or a color.  Raster data is used to represent continuous phenomena such as elevation, temperature, or precipitation.
